I'm currently living in San Jose and work at [Box Inc](https://www.box.com). I graduated from [UCSC](https://www.ucsc.edu/) with a degree in Computer Engineering. I've worked in the technology, finance & e-commerce industries over the span of my professional career in large and mid-size companies on various products & projects. I traditionally have been very good at execution, managing personalities, story-telling & analyzing user data from my experience in project, program & technical product management. I'm currently attending [SCU](https://www.scu.edu/) for my MBA (class of '20). I plan to move towards startups in the near future.
