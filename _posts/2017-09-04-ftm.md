Conventional wisdom says First-to-Market usually wins. What [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=first+to+market&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS776US776&oq=first+to+market&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.2984j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or people don't tell you is First to Market only wins if the product satisfactorily fulfills the customers' needs and if there are no other competitors in the space. Last to Market is the end game.

Another strategy that works really well...if you don't want to beat them, join them. This is my current strategy that works well in an enterprise setting. Put the petty office politics aside and may the best product win!
