excerpt: What mindset should you have and what questions should you be asking yourself before you pursuit a Masters of Business degree?

### What's was my mindset?
I had taken the GMAT's about 8 years ago and scored well enough for USC Marshall. I did not pursue an MBA then because the cost was prohibitive for someone with no real plans for what to do with the degree. If I had scored in the typical range for Stanford or Berkeley, I would have tried applying to those schools. I had no fucking clue, I was still looking for something.

> Typically an MBA is only as good as the use cases it is applied towards...unless you get into a top 5 MBA program

In which case, just go even if you don't have a plan. Proximity to the talent pool in a top program and ancillary programs makes for an amazing learning experience.

### What was I hoping to achieve with an MBA?
Top thoughts swirling through my head:
1. Entrepreneurship!
2. Insurance policy
3. Move up the corporate management ladder?

Starting my own company has been a goal I've been moving towards for the last few years. It's the reason I moved into technical product and also the reason I joined this MBA program. I'm also a risk-adverse person so it also doubles as an insurance policy in case I pivot from #1. Moving up the corporate ladder isn't a goal of mine but a consequence of #2.   

### What choices did I explore?

| Program 								|	Top 5 | Top 15 | Entrepreneur-focused? | Distance from Home | Pros 	|	Cons 	|
|-------------------------|-------|--------|-----------------------|--------------------|-------|-------|
| UC Davis (Online MBA)		| N | N |	N	|	0	| * Great low-cost option | * Little physical face-time with others for networking |  
| Stanford (Full-time MBA)| Y	|	Y |	Y	|	21 miles | * High level of immersion & learning | * High CapEx<br>High opportunity cost |
| UC Berkeley (Part-time MBA)| Y | Y | Y | 50 miles | * Medium level immersion & learning | * High CapEx cost<br>Far distance |
| SCU (Part-time MBA)	| N | Y | Y | 6 miles | * Medium level immersion & learning | * Medium CapEx cost |
| Y-Combinator (Full-time)| N/A | N/A | Y | 51 miles | * High level of immersion & learning<br>* $120k seed round | * Not everyone is accepted into the program<br>* Need to quit job<br>* Lack of certification |
| Start a company today	| N/A | N/A | Y | Depends | * Low-cost option<br>* Flexibility of time | * Support system is dependent on you<br>* Motivation |

### Closing thoughts

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/203710832" width="640" height="288" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work. Why not put them to use on your new portfolio?
