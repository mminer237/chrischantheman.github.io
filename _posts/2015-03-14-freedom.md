What does having complete freedom mean to you? What does that even look like to you?

Anarchy? Financial security? Retirement?

Total freedom for me looks like this:

I've spent the last year working for Walmart Mobile on various projects as a project manager. But I've also been working hard on other product lines as a product manager; making business decisions on these products that have substantial impact on the customer directly. I've been driven, proving myself with every new release with good results. Although I do not have the title, I am a product manager and knows how to deliver and grow a product. After one year, I am ready to be a product manager by title. Now all doors are open to me.

I'm ready to go out of Walmart and look for a product that I'm passionate about and want to build up. This can be in SF, LA, NYC...you name it. I'm making my own decisions in life and in business.

I'm also free to be closer to those that I feel will bring more value to my life. Whether it's moving closer to them or bringing them along with me for the ride.

That is complete freedom and I am so close to achieving it.

Stay hungry, stay foolish.
